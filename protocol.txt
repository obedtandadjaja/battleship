Game index page:
     Client sets up web socket with server
     Client subscribes to game index channel to be notified of any new games
     Server publishes an update event to the game index channel when a new game is created
     Upon update clients will call an AJAX get which will update the list of games available
     Password protected games require users to input password which will call an AJAX post to validate the password

Game lobby page:
     Clients set up web socket with server
     Clients subscribe to a unique channel specified in the channel column in the games table
     Server publishes an update of all players in lobby when new players enter the lobby (with web sockets)
     Server publishes an update of all players in lobby when a player leaves the lobby (with web sockets)
     When the number of players in the lobby matches the number of players specified for the game, the play button is enabled
     Any player can then start the game, which will send a web socket event of startgame
     Server publishes startgame event to the channel which will redirect all clients to a unique game page

Game page:
     All clients set up web socket with server
     Client sends guess to server
          If hit:
               Server updates all clients with hit info
               Server updates all clients with the score leaderboard
               Server updates score of the sending client
               Server checks if the ship is sunk because of the hit
               Server checks if the player has ships left (see on no ships left)
          If miss:
               Server updates sending client with miss info     
     On no ships left:
	  Server sends a message to the particular client and takes away firing privilege
     On game complete:
	  Server publishes a game over message to the channel which has information of the winner and the current leaderboard
	  For the winner, the modal will show as “You win”, and for losers, the modal will show as “You lost”
     On player disconnect from game (we have the web socket ready but not the alert yet):
	  When one of the subscriber to the channel dropped his/her connection, the server is notified
	  Send an alert to other players that the particular user disconnected
